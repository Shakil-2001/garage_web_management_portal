This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### There are 3 pre-requisites to setup a local instance of the project.

#### Install NPM packages
- Run command 'npm install' to install all required packages.

#### Setup and create a '.env.local' file in the project root folder
- File variables and keys will be attatched with the additional items along with report submission for safe keeping.

#### Setup up a local proxy 
- Required to access DVLA API. 
- Open a new instance of a terminal and execute the following command:
  - '_lcp --proxyUrl https://driver-vehicle-licensing.api.gov.uk_'

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
